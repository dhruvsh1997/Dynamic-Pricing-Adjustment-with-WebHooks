The primary difference is that some methods have more inherent security risks or require more custom security work than others. 
Security overview by method
Method 	Security Foundation	Key Vulnerabilities	Security Measures Needed
HTTP Request (REST API)	HTTPS (TLS) encryption is foundational and mandatory for security.	Excessive Data Exposure: The API returns more information than the client needs, exposing sensitive data.
Broken Authentication: Flaws in how authentication tokens are managed can lead to account takeovers.
Injection Attacks: Untrusted user input can be exploited to execute malicious commands.	For all API calls:
• Use HTTPS exclusively.
• Implement authentication with short-lived tokens and refresh tokens.
• Enforce authorization rules on every request.
• Validate and sanitize all inputs.
API Polling (over HTTP)	Inherits the security of the underlying HTTP requests and the API endpoint being polled.	DoS/DDoS Attacks: Frequent, automated polling can be exploited to overwhelm the server with requests.
Data Exposure: Polling can be less efficient than event-driven methods and may increase the chance of data exposure if not properly secured.	In addition to HTTP best practices:
• Implement strict rate limiting to prevent abuse.
• Require authentication for every request.
• Keep the API inventory and documentation strictly maintained to avoid "shadow APIs".
Webhooks	Secure via HTTPS and HMAC signatures, which verify the message came from a trusted sender and was not tampered with.	Request Forgery (SSRF): A malicious actor can trick the server into sending the webhook to an internal endpoint.
Replay Attacks: An attacker intercepts and resends a legitimate webhook message.
Endpoint Vulnerabilities: Webhook URLs are public-facing, making them potential targets for injection attacks.	For all webhook endpoints:
• Use HTTPS exclusively.
• Validate the webhook with a signature (HMAC) and a shared secret.
• Add timestamps to messages to prevent replay attacks.
• Restrict the IP addresses that can send requests.
WebSockets	Secured with the WSS protocol, the equivalent of HTTPS for WebSockets, which uses TLS encryption.	Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWH): An attacker on a different site can make a WebSocket connection using a user's session cookies.
Missing Authentication: Because authentication is not part of the native protocol, developers can forget to enforce checks on every message.
Injection Attacks: Lack of input validation can open the door to classic injection vulnerabilities.	For all WebSocket connections:
• Use the wss:// protocol.
• Validate the Origin header during the handshake.
• Require token-based authentication for the initial handshake.
• Authorize every message sent through the connection.
Server-Sent Events (SSE)	Since SSE is based on HTTP, its security foundation is the HTTPS protocol, which provides TLS encryption.	Man-in-the-Middle (MitM): If not using HTTPS, an attacker can intercept the plaintext stream.
Authentication Issues: Similar to WebSockets, the continuous nature of the connection requires careful handling of session authentication.	For all SSE streams:
• Always use HTTPS.
• Validate session and authentication on initial connection.
• Handle errors and reconnections securely.
Which is right for you?
The best choice depends on your specific use case, data sensitivity, and control over both client and server applications.
Use HTTP Requests for:
Standard, non-real-time client-to-server communication, such as retrieving a resource.
APIs where you have full control over the authentication and validation. 
Use API Polling for:
Infrequent updates from an API that doesn't need to be immediate.
Integrating with legacy systems or third-party APIs that don't offer event-driven alternatives like webhooks. 
Use Webhooks for:
Event-driven server-to-server communication.
When you need real-time notifications from a third-party service, such as a payment processor. 
Use WebSockets or SSE for:
Real-time applications that require a continuous, low-latency stream of data.
WebSockets are ideal for bidirectional (client and server) communication like live chat or multiplayer gaming.
SSE is simpler and better suited for unidirectional, server-to-client events like live sports scores or stock market updates.
